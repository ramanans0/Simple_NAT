# Simple_NAT

Coding:

I ran out of time while bugchecking. I couldn't find an issue with the string comparison that caused the comparison to run too long.

Submission:

I tested my solution using the sample provided in the email. I used argv to read in the filenames for NAT and FLOW in that order. The code could also use optimization in the string comparison segments, which are rather simple. I wanted to avoid issues caused by complexity so I didn't use more efficient algorithms. If I were to make my code more efficient, that's where I would do so.
